# Test 
My first ever repo, using code from when I was 14, please don't judge.  
Crazy is Normal handcricket, but with a few extra rules:-  
-the bowler gets a wicket if the difference between the two throws is one (eg: if you as the batter throw 7, and the bolwer throws 6, he/she gets a wicket)  
-if the two throws are the same, then the runs you would normally have scored get squared (eg: if both the bolwer and the batter thrwo 8, 64 (aka 8 squared) gets added to the batters run total)  
-it's 5 overs for now, plan to fix that, along with the general spiderweb code in the future.
